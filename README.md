# Dinosaur Reader
##

www.qwantz.com is the home of Dinosaur comics, a web comic that always uses 
the same panels but different words. It is one of my favorite comics to browse
but unfortunately it does not have a random button. This application allows 
for the reading of these comics and has a random button. 

This project requires JSoup to run which is included in the repository. 

the code can be compiled with
	
	java -cp .:jsoup-1.9.1.jar *.java

and can be run with

	java -cp .:jsoup-1.9.1.jar Comic

www.qwantz.com and Dinosaur Comics is great and I encourage users to go there.
